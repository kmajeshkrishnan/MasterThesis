	abstract = {We consider a variant of the multidimensional assignment problem (MAP) with decomposable costs in which the resulting optimal assignment is described as a set of disjoint stars. This problem arises in the context of multi-sensor multi-target tracking problems, where a set of measurements, obtained from a collection of sensors, must be associated to a set of different targets. To solve this problem we study two different formulations. First, we introduce a continuous nonlinear program and its linearization, along with additional valid inequalities that improve the lower bounds. Second, we state the standard MAP formulation as a set partitioning problem, and solve it via branch and price. These approaches were put to test by solving instances ranging from tripartite to 20-partite graphs of 4 to 30 nodes per partition. Computational results show that our approaches are a viable option to solve this problem. A comparative study is presented.}

abstract="This paper addresses the problem of discovering the objects present in a collection of images without any supervision. We build on the optimization approach of Vo et al.[34] with several key novelties: (1) We propose a novel saliency-based region proposal algorithm that achieves significantly higher overlap with ground-truth objects than other competitive methods. This procedure leverages off-the-shelf CNN features trained on classification tasks without any bounding box information, but is otherwise unsupervised. (2) We exploit the inherent hierarchical structure of proposals as an effective regularizer for the approach to object discovery of[34], boosting its performance to significantly improve over the state of the art on several standard benchmarks. (3) We adopt a two-stage strategy to select promising proposals using small random sets of images before using the whole image collection to discover the objects it depicts, allowing us to tackle, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), the discovery of multiple objects in each one of the pictures making up datasets with up to 20,000 images, an over five-fold increase compared to existing methods, and a first step toward true large-scale unsupervised image interpretation.",
